# ALCOHOL-DETECTOR-AND-ENGINE-LOCKING-SYSTEM
This project is designed to enhance road safety by preventing drunk driving. The system uses an alcohol sensor (MQ-3) to detect alcohol levels in a driver’s breath. If the alcohol concentration exceeds a predefined limit, the system automatically: ✅ Triggers an alert (e.g., buzzer or LED) ✅ Disables the vehicle’s engine to prevent ignition
